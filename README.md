# Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-to-detect-anomalies-in-network-traffic


This repository is part of an exploratory research project aimed at leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the detection of anomalies in network traffic. Our objective is to innovate within the field of cybersecurity by applying GANs to identify deviations that may indicate security threats. 

Within this space, we document our iterative process, encompassing the development of algorithms, data handling strategies, and validation approaches. We are committed to regular updates to share our progress and insights as the project evolves. 

The initiative is ongoing, and we anticipate its conclusion once our goals have been achieved and our methodologies are thoroughly vetted. This repository serves as a living record of our journey towards enhancing network security through advanced anomaly detection techniques."
